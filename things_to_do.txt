1) Time series analysis - 

Once I get more data - First bin the events by month and look at how the number of events change month to month over all.

See how number of events change day over day.

Then segment the data by event type.

Show the how the frequency of each of these types of events changes over time.

Next we'll predict how many of each event will occur over the next three months and how many events will occur in aggregate.

2) Location plotting

Show on a map where these events occur, allow for filtering by event type (just loads a different map, no need to be fancy).

Do some clustering analysis by doing the following - The question is how likely is an event of a given type to occur in a given place.  This will be a textual output of the following form:

* Park name:
	Event type 1: probability of event occurring
	Event type 2: probability of event occurring
	etc.

Then let's predict event type based on location, time of year, and time of day.
